# Classification Errors

Computing the classification errors between unquantized and quantized neural networks.

The experiment pipeline consists of the two following steps:

1. `train_network.sh` ‚Äì for training the baseline model.
2. `compute_errors.sh` ‚Äì for computing the errors between unquantized and quantized neural networks using linear and non-linear programming techniques.

## 1. `train_network.sh`

### üéØ Purpose

This script trains a neural network on the MNIST dataset.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Parameters

| Variable          | Description                               |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `EPOCHS`          | Starting index of samples to evaluate     |
| `BATCH_SIZE`      | Ending index of samples to evaluate       |
| `CHECKPOINT_DIR`  | Number of quantization bits               |


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example Usage

```bash
./train_network.sh
```

## 2. `run_experiment.sh`

### üéØ Purpose

This script performs a linear programming-based analysis to estimate worst-case quantization errors of a trained neural network.
